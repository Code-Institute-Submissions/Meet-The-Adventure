# Meet-The-Adventure
Climbing and Hiking blog. The design should be responsive on phones, tablets, and desktops for fellow travelers and adventures people.


 ## UX  User Experience 
* Gaol 

a. Green lush website theme will meet the new user.  
b. I want the user to be intrigued to click around the site intuitively.

* Regular visitor

a. Should be presented with buying equipment, clothes, and ideas about where and what to do.   

* Community visitor

a. The user is given options on events and group activities.    

* Design
1. Images should evoke the inner adventurer's feelings to go out into the wild!
2. Fonts should be something simple to not draw attention from the pictures
3. Right now I see dark green colors

* Wireframes

It's designed to give entertaining stories, places to visit, marketing for clothes and equipment. 

## overview

### Workflow
1. 2021-03-28 to 31/3 
* The first picture in the Instagram grid is my own and it's linked to my Instagram where I might public my hiking stories and ideas. Started the project with the Instagram grid and work from there. Used Bootstrap to make the grid.
* (I don't feel I have time to sit down and think of a wireframe at the moment, I have the layout in my head. There is an example of a wireframe in my side project RobinAves. I intended to use that as my first milestone but after the Mentor call I decided to wait until my skillset is better for it.)

* I found the color codes from my desktop picture, the image was downloaded from https://pixabay.com a year ago and then used photoshop to find the color codes for the website.
I have also used it as my background, the credit can be found further down.
* Started to build a shop but that's far more than I can handle, so it's just an example for now. The idea is taken from a Bootstrap theme at https://colorlib.com/preview/#ashion and then do the adjustments to fit my website or if I change it totally when I have the experience to build it on my own. I don't know if this counts as plagiarism but this is more to show how I would like it to be. Sent an email to a company that I maybe would like to work with someday, side topic. I want to use some pictures and link to their webpage.

3. 2021-04-01
* Building the Adventure page where I will change the blog post to Climbing and Hiking information from other websites that I will link to. Credit for thoughts is also further down. 
* Changed the website so it has a hero-image and moved the "logo" there as well. In its place, I will put the social media accounts. 

4. 2021-04-02
* I changed the shop page so that there can be an external shop. Did this so I don't need to worry about plagiarism! Think of it as if I was sponsored by a company or several companies.

* #### Debugging 
 I had to override a bootstrap for the images in shop to stand in line. It didn't work out as I wanted it, tried to use the class tag and copy it through dev tools, so I had to use id instead and it worked :) 

* #### Debugging
When I have too different amount of text in post and adventure section, the boxes changes, I could perhaps do something like hinheret but it works for good for now.
Still got issues with this, I will need to look closer into that when I do the a propper debugging.

* #### Debugging
Mager bug with git. I couldn't push. Don't know how many times I tried and looked for other solutions. In the end, I just made a new main on my computer and copied the code, and moved the images. I read at stack overflow that it can be trublesum to push too much at the same time. So I divided the uploads to the new respiratory on my computer or the new place I cloned my respiratory too. It seems to work, though... I'm not done yet!!

5. 2021-04-03 
* Wrote a paragraph in the instagram section under the images. Have been trying to get some links to get javascripts on to my website, in order to make the image interactive but with no result. The work around was to do the paragraph and then the background interactive. I still trying to find a way to make the post section more like that, so you can clearly se that you hover over it. Now its just the Click me that gets an underline. I will probably redo that section and make it as I made the shop, free hand that is. Took the Post section from Bootstrap Themes.

* Hover effect on shop images
* Have added some new interactive futures, video, social links, linked to other pages I like. Turnes out to be a website for the things I find exciting :)
