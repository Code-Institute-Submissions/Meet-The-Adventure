# Meet-The-Adventure
Climbing and Hiking blog. The design should be responsive on phones, tablets, and desktops for fellow travelers and adventures people.


 ## UX  User Experience 
* Gaol 

a. Green lush website theme will meet the new user.  
b. I want the user to be intrigued to click around the site intuitively.

* Regular visitor

a. Should be presented with buying equipment, clothes, and ideas about where and what to do.   

* Community visitor

a. The user is given options on events and group activities.    

* Design
1. Images should evoke the inner adventurer's feelings to go out into the wild!
2. Fonts should be something simple to not draw attention from the pictures
3. Right now I see dark green colors

* Wireframes

It's designed to give entertaining stories, places to visit, marketing for clothes and equipment. 

## Workflow
1. 2021-03-28 to 31/3 
* The first picture in the Instagram grid is my own and it's linked to my Instagram where I might public my hiking stories and ideas. Started the project with the Instagram grid and work from there. Used Bootstrap to make the grid.
* (I don't feel I have time to sit down and think of a wireframe at the moment, I have the layout in my head. There is an example of a wireframe in my side project RobinAves. I intended to use that as my first milestone but after the Mentor call I decided to wait until my skillset is better for it.)

* I found the color codes from my desktop picture, the image was downloaded from https://pixabay.com a year ago and then used photoshop to find the color codes for the website.
I have also used it as my background, the credit can be found further down.
* Started to build a shop but that's far more than I can handle, so it's just an example for now. The idea is taken from a Bootstrap theme at https://colorlib.com/preview/#ashion and then do the adjustments to fit my website or if I change it totally when I have the experience to build it on my own. I don't know if this counts as plagiarism but this is more to show how I would like it to be. Sent an email to a company that I maybe would like to work with someday, side topic. I want to use some pictures and link to their webpage.

3. 2021-04-01
* Building the Adventure page where I will change the blog post to Climbing and Hiking information from other websites that I will link to. Credit for thoughts is also further down. 
* Changed the website so it has a hero-image and moved the "logo" there as well. In its place, I will put the social media accounts. 

4. 2021-04-02
* I changed the shop page so that there can be an external shop. Did this so I don't need to worry about plagiarism! Think of it as if I was sponsored by a company or several companies.

* #### Debugging 
 I had to override a bootstrap for the images in shop to stand in line. It didn't work out as I wanted it, tried to use the class tag and copy it through dev tools, so I had to use id instead and it worked :) 

* #### Debugging
When I have too different amount of text in post and adventure section, the boxes changes, I could perhaps do something like hinheret but it works for good for now.
Still got issues with this, I will need to look closer into that when I do the a propper debugging.

* #### Debugging
Mager bug with git. I couldn't push. Don't know how many times I tried and looked for other solutions. In the end, I just made a new main on my computer and copied the code, and moved the images. I read at stack overflow that it can be trublesum to push too much at the same time. So I divided the uploads to the new respiratory on my computer or the new place I cloned my respiratory too. It seems to work, though... I'm not done yet!!

5. 2021-04-03 
* Wrote a paragraph in the instagram section under the images. Have been trying to get some links to get javascripts on to my website, in order to make the image interactive but with no result. The work around was to do the paragraph and then the background interactive. I still trying to find a way to make the post section more like that, so you can clearly se that you hover over it. Now its just the Click me that gets an underline. I will probably redo that section and make it as I made the shop, free hand that is. Took the Post section from Bootstrap Themes.
* Made the contact page from a bootstrap example and changed it to look nice on my contact page.
* Hover effect on shop images
* Have added some new interactive futures, video, social links, linked to other pages I like. Turnes out to be a website for the things I find exciting :)

# issues

## Responsinator

### Hamburger Menu
1. I would like the hamburger menu on the smaller devices to be white 
2. I think I need some javascript for it to work, not so familiar with hamburger menus. 
I looked at some youtube videos and the problem is solved :)


### iPad
1. The post section (Wim Hof and Climbing) needs some sort of @media so the boxes are at the same height.

___________________________________________________
## Look & Feel

### Fonts

1. Look for better fonts and change sizes where needed.
2. not sure if I like the hover border radius I have put on the nav menu. It's different so that's maybe why I have mixed experiences with them.
Solved I chaned it, it looked even more strange in the hamburger menu.

### images & video

1. I would like the video to correlate more on the landing page with the image of the hammocks on the right side.

### Responsive

1. I have tried out lots of ways to make the box, images or the text responsive when hover over the post section (Wim hof, etc) but the only thing that happens is that I get an underline. Its easy to miss that if you hover over the image and the "click here" and "Continue Reading" gets underlined. For me, that's not even close and as a user, you might miss that. On the other hand, the text is clear of what to do if you want to know more.

2. Maybe have some sort of light background on the Instagram text so they stand out more.

## External links

### Social Media

1. √ç think that it's better to Change Facebook to Linkedin

## Last thoughts

1. I didn't have in mind that this would be so, well, self-centered. There are a couple of other interests of mine that's not on the sight so perhaps change the shop to Creation, Creativity, or something like that and link to my music and all that "content creator" stuff I like to do... Idk, I don't have enough content at the moment, this is just my thoughts right now.

### Code used
Overall I have only used the skeleton of other code and then change it. So, as for me, I would not regard it as plagiarism to use ideas from someone else and then change it to fit my work. You should not need to invent the wheel every time, it's a fine line and very much up to the beholder to make that statement.
1. Insta: Looked at the Instagram section here: https://demo.bootstraptemple.com/travel/ 
2. Haeder: Looked here for the heading: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/
3. Post section: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/blog/
4. Shop section: I build totally myself from scratch, I think that I will use that for my Post section instead because the post section doesn't behave as I want it to.
